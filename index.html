          <li>The HKOI is a yearly computer programming competition for secondary school students in Hong Kong.</li>
          <li>The competition emphasizes problem-solving abilities and programming skills.</li>
          <li>It is organized by the Hong Kong Association for Computer Education, the Education Bureau of the Hong Kong SAR Government, and the computer science departments of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the City University of Hong Kong.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By utilizing the platform for learning, I have gained significant advantages in my programming skills, understanding of algorithms, and problem-solving abilities. Given the circumstances, I now feel like a novice explorer of programming.</p>
