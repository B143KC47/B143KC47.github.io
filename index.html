          <li>The HKOI is a yearly computer programming competition for secondary school students in Hong Kong.</li>
          <li>The competition emphasizes problem-solving abilities and programming skills.</li>
          <li>It is organized by the Hong Kong Association for Computer Education, the Education Bureau of the Hong Kong SAR Government, and the computer science departments of the Chinese University of Hong Kong and the City University of Hong Kong.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By utilizing the platform for learning, <b>I have gained significant advantages in my programming skills, understanding of algorithms, and problem-solving abilities</b>. Given the circumstances, I now feel like a novice explorer of programming.</p>

          <li>The Hong Kong Innovation Node was founded in 2015.</li>
          <li>Its objectives include improving the innovation capabilities of MIT students.</li>
          <li>It seeks to create more opportunities for students and faculty to participate in innovation.</li>
          <li>It aims to speed up the idea-to-impact process to strengthen the innovation ecosystem in the region.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I had the opportunity to participate in the English bootcamp organized by the Hong Kong Innovation Node, where <b> I gained valuable insights into cultivating an entrepreneurial mindset and creating products that benefit society.</b> Through the bootcamp, I learned step-by-step methods for product development and gained a deeper understanding of how to foster a spirit of innovation.</p>
